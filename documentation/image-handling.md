# Image Handling in ReturnTracker

## Overview

ReturnTracker uses a robust image handling strategy to ensure optimal performance and reliability across different platforms. This document outlines the approach to image management, loading, and display throughout the application.

## Image Loading Strategy

### Asset Preloading

The app uses Expo's Asset system to preload critical images during startup:

```typescript
const preloadAssets = async () => {
  const imageAssets = [
    require('../assets/images/icon.png'),
    require('../assets/images/favicon.png'),
  ];
  
  const loadImages = imageAssets.map(image => {
    if (typeof image === 'string') {
      return Image.prefetch(image);
    } else {
      return Asset.fromModule(image).downloadAsync();
    }
  });
  
  await Promise.all(loadImages);
};
```

This approach ensures that essential images are loaded before the app is displayed to the user, preventing flickering or missing images during initial rendering.

### Dynamic Image Loading

For non-critical images or those loaded during runtime, the app uses standard React Native image loading:

```typescript
<Image 
  source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' }} 
  style={styles.image} 
/>
```

### Remote Images

For remote images, the app implements:

1. **Placeholder Images**: Displayed while the actual image is loading
2. **Error Handling**: Fallback images shown if the remote image fails to load
3. **Caching**: Images are cached to improve performance and reduce data usage

```typescript
<Image
  source={{ uri: imageUrl }}
  defaultSource={require('../assets/images/placeholder.png')}
  onError={() => setImageError(true)}
  style={styles.image}
/>
```

## Icon-Based Approach

To avoid issues with static image files, ReturnTracker uses a vector icon-based approach for UI elements:

### Icon Components

The app uses Lucide React Native for vector icons, which are rendered as SVG components:

```typescript
import { Clock, Package, DollarSign } from 'lucide-react-native';

// Usage
<Clock size={24} color="#3B82F6" />
```

### Icon with Background

For more complex visual elements, the app combines icons with styled containers:

```typescript
<LinearGradient
  colors={['#3B82F6', '#2563EB']}
  style={styles.iconBackground}
  start={{ x: 0, y: 0 }}
  end={{ x: 1, y: 1 }}
>
  <Icon size={80} color="#FFFFFF" />
</LinearGradient>
```

## Onboarding Screens

The onboarding screens use a combination of vector icons and gradient backgrounds instead of static images:

```typescript
const onboardingData = [
  {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Never Miss a Return Deadline',
    description: '...',
    icon: Clock,
    colors: ['#3B82F6', '#2563EB'],
  },
  // More screens...
];
```

This approach offers several advantages:
- Smaller bundle size
- Resolution independence
- Easier customization
- Better performance
- Fewer loading issues

## Best Practices

### 1. Image Optimization

- Use appropriate image formats (JPEG for photos, PNG for transparency, SVG for icons)
- Compress images to reduce file size
- Provide multiple resolutions for different device densities

### 2. Loading States

- Always show loading indicators or placeholders while images are loading
- Handle loading errors gracefully with fallback images

### 3. Caching

- Implement proper caching strategies for frequently used images
- Clear cache periodically to prevent excessive storage usage

### 4. Performance Considerations

- Lazy load images that are not immediately visible
- Use image resizing services for remote images
- Consider using progressive JPEG for large images

### 5. Accessibility

- Provide proper alt text for all images
- Ensure sufficient contrast for text overlaid on images
- Test with screen readers to verify accessibility

## Platform-Specific Considerations

### Web

- Implement proper lazy loading for web
- Use modern image formats like WebP where supported
- Consider using the `<picture>` element for responsive images

### iOS

- Be mindful of memory usage with large images
- Use iOS-specific optimizations when available

### Android

- Handle different screen densities appropriately
- Be aware of memory constraints on lower-end devices

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Missing or Broken Images

If images fail to load:

1. Verify the image path or URL is correct
2. Check that the image file exists and is not corrupted
3. Ensure the image format is supported
4. Implement error handling to show fallback images

### Performance Issues

If image loading affects performance:

1. Reduce image size and resolution
2. Implement proper caching
3. Lazy load images not immediately visible
4. Consider using vector graphics (SVG) where appropriate

### Memory Issues

If the app experiences memory problems related to images:

1. Resize images to the actual dimensions needed
2. Release image resources when no longer needed
3. Implement progressive loading for large images
4. Monitor memory usage during development
